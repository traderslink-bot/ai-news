      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>AlphaTON Capital (NASDAQ: ATON) announced it signed and closed a $30 million AI compute infrastructure lease to add 504 NVIDIA B200 GPUs to a Canadian data center, with delivery this week. The company projects the deployment will generate a minimum of $1.2M monthly beginning March 2026 (company example: $4–$6/hour per B200; 504 x $4/hr x 24 x 30 = $1.45M/month) and says the deployment achieves a 1.7x return multiple and 40% IRR. AlphaTON expects its B200 and B300 chips to be fully online by April 2026 (1,080 total chips estimated monthly revenue $3.11M) and previously signed a $46M agreement for 576 B300 GPUs with a five-year colocation in Sweden. The release highlights prior pilot revenue, 340% month-over-month inference-request growth on its Cocoon AI network, and frames the deployments as capital-efficient, privacy-centric AI infrastructure expansion.</p>
