      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>AlphaTON Capital announced execution of a binding call option agreement granting Immunova (or an affiliate) the option to acquire iOx Therapeutics, a wholly owned AlphaTON subsidiary developing liposomal iNKT agonists. If exercised and closed, AlphaTON would receive an upfront cash payment at closing, equity equal to 10% of the fully diluted equity of the acquiring entity at exercise, potential milestone payments in excess of $100 million, and single-digit royalties on future net sales, per definitive documentation. iOx's lead candidate PORT-2 (IMM60) has Phase 1/2 clinical data showing tolerability, biomarker evidence of immune activation, and preliminary anti-tumor activity. The option is subject to conditions (including Immunova securing financing) and may not be exercised; transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions. AlphaTON said it will continue advancing other programs, including dosing the first patient in its mesothelioma program (TT-4) and pursuing a Telegram-oriented AI biotech initiative.</p>
