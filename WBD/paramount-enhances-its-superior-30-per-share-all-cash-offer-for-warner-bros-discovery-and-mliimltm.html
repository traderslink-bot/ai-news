      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Paramount Skydance amended its $30.00 per-share all-cash tender offer for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), adding a $0.25 per-share quarterly 'ticking fee' for delays after Dec 31, 2026, agreeing to fund the $2.8bn termination fee payable to Netflix, and offering to backstop/fully reimburse up to $1.5bn of WBD's potential debt-exchange costs if needed. The deal is fully financed by $43.6bn of equity commitments (Ellison Family and RedBird) and $54.0bn of debt commitments (Bank of America, Citigroup, Apollo), with a $43.3bn irrevocable personal guarantee from Larry Ellison. Paramount certified compliance with the DOJ second request on Feb 9, 2026 and secured German clearance on Jan 27, 2026; the tender offer expiration was extended to March 2, 2026 and 42,345,815 shares had been validly tendered as of Feb 9, 2026. Paramount intends to solicit proxies against the Netflix transaction and emphasizes its offer’s greater cash certainty versus the Netflix proposal.</p>
