      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Brenmiller Energy (NASDAQ: BNRG) announced the launch of bGen ONE(TM), a standardized, factory-built, modular version of its bGen thermal energy storage (TES) platform. The design shifts major assembly from field EPC work into Brenmiller's manufacturing operations, targeting >50% reduction in on-site labor/construction scope and moving ~25% of project scope into the company's factory to potentially improve margins and repeatability. bGen ONE is positioned for small- and mid-scale industrial heat customers and to support localized manufacturing and regional clean-energy funding frameworks. The release contains forward-looking statements and discloses no new contracts, financial guidance, or firm orders.</p>
