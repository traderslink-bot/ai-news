      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Novocure (NASDAQ: NVCR) announced FDA approval of Optune Pax® for adult patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer to be used concomitantly with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Approval is based on the Phase 3 PANOVA-3 trial (n=571) which met its primary endpoint: in the ITT population median overall survival (mOS) was 16.2 months with Optune Pax + gem/nab-pac versus 14.2 months with gem/nab-pac alone (HR 0.82; p=0.039). In the modified per-protocol population mOS was 18.3 vs 15.1 months (HR 0.77; p=0.023). Optune Pax also improved one-year survival rates and extended median time to pain progression (15.2 vs 9.1 months). There were no new systemic safety signals and serious adverse events were comparable between arms; device-related skin adverse events occurred in 76.3% of Optune Pax-treated patients (mostly Grade 1-2; 7.7% Grade ≥3). Several secondary endpoints (progression-free survival, objective response rate, local PFS, tumor resectability) showed no significant difference between arms. Results were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.</p>
