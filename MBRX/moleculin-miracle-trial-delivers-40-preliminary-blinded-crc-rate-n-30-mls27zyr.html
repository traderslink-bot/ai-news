      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Moleculin Biotech (NASDAQ: MBRX) reported preliminary blinded efficacy from its Phase 2B/3 MIRACLE trial of Annamycin plus cytarabine in relapsed/refractory AML: a composite complete remission rate (CRc) of 40% among the first 30 subjects (CR 30%, CRh 10%). The company has treated 35 subjects to date with ~11 more identified and is targeting treatment of 45 subjects in Q1 2026, followed by unblinding (expected late Q2 2026 after data lock). The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled adaptive Part A will compare two Annamycin dosing arms plus cytarabine versus cytarabine plus placebo; the first unblinding should include ~30 Annamycin subjects and ~15 control subjects. Company highlights: ~35% of treated subjects are prior venetoclax regimen failures, absence of observed cardiotoxicity in prior trials (90 subjects), Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations, and composition-of-matter patent protection through 2040 (potential extension to 2045). The release notes the data are preliminary/blinded and subject to audit and lock, recruitment challenges, and that the company will require significant additional financing.</p>
