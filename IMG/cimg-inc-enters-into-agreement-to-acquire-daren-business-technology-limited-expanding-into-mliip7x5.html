      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>CIMG Inc. (Nasdaq: IMG) announced that its subsidiary DZR Tech Limited entered into a definitive share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of Daren Business Technology Limited. The aggregate purchase consideration is approximately $40 million paid in CIMG shares held in escrow and released in four phases from April 2026 through September 2029, contingent on audited revenue performance targets of $29M (Apr–Sep 2026), $71M (Oct 2026–Sep 2027), $143M (Oct 2027–Sep 2028) and $257M (Oct 2028–Sep 2029). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including satisfactory due diligence, with closing expected within 30 days of the agreement. Daren is described as a biomedicine R&D, production, marketing and technical services provider; CIMG states the acquisition furthers its diversification into the biopharmaceutical industry.</p>

      <strong>Positives</strong>
      <ul><li>Strategic diversification into the biopharmaceutical sector (high-growth industry as stated by the company).</li><li>Consideration structured as escrowed shares tied to performance aligns seller incentives with Daren’s future revenue targets.</li><li>Escrowed, phased share release reduces immediate cash outflow and ties payment to measurable milestones.</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Negatives</strong>
      <ul><li>Consideration to be paid in Company shares (approx. $40M), which may dilute existing shareholders.</li><li>Release of escrowed shares is contingent on substantial revenue targets ($29M, $71M, $143M, $257M); failure to meet targets leads to reduction/cancellation of shares.</li><li>Transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions including due diligence and is not yet closed.</li></ul>
