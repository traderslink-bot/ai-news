      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: VNDA) announced FDA approval of BYSANTI™ (milsaperidone) tablets for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. BYSANTI is a new chemical entity that rapidly interconverts to iloperidone and demonstrated bioequivalence to iloperidone across therapeutic doses, allowing Vanda to leverage established efficacy and safety data. Vanda expects commercial availability in Q3 2026; marketing exclusivity and issued U.S. patents are expected to provide protection with the latest patent estimated to expire in 2044. BYSANTI is also being studied as a once-daily adjunctive treatment for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (study expected to complete by year-end). The release includes full prescribing information and multiple safety warnings (including a boxed warning for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis) and common adverse reactions.</p>
