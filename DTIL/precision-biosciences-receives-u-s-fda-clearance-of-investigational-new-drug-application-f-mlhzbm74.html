      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Precision BioSciences (NASDAQ: DTIL) received a Study May Proceed notification from the U.S. FDA for its IND for PBGENE-DMD, enabling IRB review and clinical site activation for the Phase 1/2 FUNCTION-DMD trial in ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients with mutations in exons 45–55 (~60% of patients). PBGENE-DMD is a first-in-class in vivo ARCUS gene excision therapy delivered by a single AAV encoding two ARCUS proteins designed to restore a near full-length functional dystrophin (~80% of full length). The program has supportive preclinical data showing durable functional improvements across skeletal and cardiac muscle and editing of muscle satellite cells, and has FDA Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations. Precision is targeting first U.S. site activation in H1 2026 and expects initial multi-patient data by year-end 2026; a virtual investor event is planned in March.</p>

      <strong>Positives</strong>
      <ul><li>FDA Study May Proceed notification allows initiation of IRB activities and clinical site activations for the Phase 1/2 trial</li><li>PBGENE-DMD targets exons 45–55, addressing the largest molecular subset of DMD (~60% of patients)</li><li>Therapy is designed to produce near full-length dystrophin (~80% of full length), larger than current micro-dystrophin constructs</li><li>Preclinical data reportedly show durable functional improvements in skeletal and cardiac muscle and editing of satellite muscle stem cells</li><li>Program has FDA Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations</li><li>Company outlines a clear near-term timeline: target first U.S. site activation in H1 2026 and initial patient data by year-end 2026</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Negatives</strong>
      <ul><li>Study May Proceed is not approval of safety or efficacy — PBGENE-DMD remains unproven in humans and is still investigational</li><li>Clinical outcomes, dosing, long-term durability and safety (including immune responses to AAV/gene editing) remain uncertain</li><li>Timelines are forward-looking and contingent on IRB approvals, site activations, enrollment, and regulatory interactions</li><li>Forward-looking statements highlight multiple program and regulatory risks that could delay or alter development plans</li></ul>
