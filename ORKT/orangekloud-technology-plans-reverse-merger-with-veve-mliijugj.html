      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Orangekloud Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: ORKT) announced a non-binding Letter of Intent to negotiate a reverse merger acquisition of Orbis Technology Limited's flagship consumer brand and marketplace, VeVe. The proposed transaction contemplates Orangekloud issuing shares privately to acquire the entire issued share capital and undertaking of Orbis. After the transaction, Orbis co-founders/shareholders would collectively hold a majority of Orangekloud's issued shares and existing Orangekloud shareholders would hold a minority stake; the company expects to retain its dual-class share structure. Parties aim to finalize terms and move to a definitive implementation agreement on or around February 28, 2026. The release reiterates forward-looking statement cautions.</p>
