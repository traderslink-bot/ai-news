      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Expion360 (NASDAQ: XPON) and Dealer Accessory Supply (DAS) announced a strategic partnership to launch the DASGen Hybrid Energy Storage System for construction and industrial job sites. DASGen pairs Expion360's LiFePO4 battery technology with industrial power electronics to act as an energy buffer between diesel generators and site loads, aiming to reduce generator runtime, diesel consumption, noise, emissions, and operating/maintenance costs. DAS will serve as final system assembler; Expion360 will supply batteries and lead sales/marketing. A cited field deployment on a site with a 25 kW generator reportedly showed decreased generator runtime and lower diesel use. No financial terms, production timeline, or contract volumes were disclosed. The release contains forward-looking statements and notes results may vary by site conditions and usage.</p>
