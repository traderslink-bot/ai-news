      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release from STRATA Skin Sciences (NASDAQ: SSKN) highlighting a February 2026 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology that found 308 nm excimer laser therapy produces statistically significant reductions in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores for plaque psoriasis. Reviewed trials (examples cited: Tang n=32, He n=40, Gerber n=100, Dong n=20) showed PASI reductions of ~56%–85%; patients typically achieved results within 10–14 treatments (≈5–7 weeks). The analysis emphasized MED-guided dosing with per-session fluences generally ~200–600 mJ/cm² (and protocols up to ~1,200 mJ/cm² total), supporting the use of high-fluence, targeted devices. STRATA notes its high-power XTRAC models enable delivery of these optimized doses and frames the meta-analysis as academic validation of targeted excimer laser therapy. The release includes standard forward-looking statement caution and investor contact information.</p>
