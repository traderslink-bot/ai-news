      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Jaguar Health (NASDAQ: JAGX) announced its Board declared a one-time Special Stock Dividend payable March 4, 2026 to holders of common stock and certain warrants of record on March 2, 2026. The dividend will consist of Series O Convertible Preferred Stock, which the Company may convert into common stock at its election (or which will automatically convert on December 31, 2026 if not earlier converted). Conversion will be based on the market price of the common stock at the time. The Preferred Stock is non-transferable and will not be listed or tradable. The company says the dividend is intended to provide dilution protection to shareholders while it explores pathways to repay or restructure existing indebtedness; Jaguar referenced an 8-K filed February 18, 2026 for additional terms. The release also highlights recent non-dilutive licensing with Future Pak and ongoing clinical development of crofelemer with a target NDA filing for MVID in H1 2027.</p>
