      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>RenX Enterprises Corporation (NASDAQ: RENX) announced a PIPE financing of approximately $6.0 million consisting of Senior Convertible Notes and attached warrants. The Notes total $6.0M principal, bear 12% annual interest, mature in 13 months, and are convertible at the holder's option at a fixed conversion price of $0.281 per share. The Company will also issue warrants equal to 100% of the face value of the Notes, exercisable for six years at $0.15594 per share. Dawson James is the sole placement agent; the offering is expected to close on or about February 13, 2026, and is being conducted as a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D. The Company agreed to customary registration rights for the resale of shares underlying the Notes and Warrants and intends to use net proceeds primarily for working capital.</p>
