      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Solana Company (NASDAQ: HSDT) announced a tri-party custody model with Anchorage Digital (collateral manager) and Kamino (on-chain lending) that enables institutions to borrow against natively staked SOL while keeping assets in segregated accounts at Anchorage Digital Bank. The structure allows borrowers to continue earning native staking rewards (~7% cited) while accessing on-chain liquidity, using Anchorage's Atlas collateral management for 24/7 automated LTV oversight, margin movements, and rules-based liquidations. Solana Company positions the model as a repeatable blueprint to bring institutional capital to Solana's DeFi ecosystem; HSDT remains focused on accumulating SOL as its principal business objective.</p>
