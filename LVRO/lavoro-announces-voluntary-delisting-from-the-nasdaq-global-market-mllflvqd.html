      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Lavoro Limited (NASDAQ: LVRO, LVROW) announced a board-approved decision to voluntarily delist its ordinary shares (par value $0.001) and warrants (exercise price $11.50) from the Nasdaq Global Market. The company intends to file a Form 25 with the SEC on or about February 24, 2026 (expected last Nasdaq trading day on or about February 23, 2026) and to file a Form 15 on or about March 6, 2026 to suspend reporting under Sections 12(g) and 15(d). Lavoro cited a challenging Brazilian market environment, low trading volume, a limited public shareholder base, and significant costs and compliance burdens (audit, legal, Sarbanes-Oxley, SEC and Nasdaq requirements) as reasons for the delisting. After delisting, trading would be limited to privately negotiated sales or potentially OTC markets, but there is no guarantee a broker will make a market.</p>
