      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Evogene (Nasdaq/TASE: EVGN) entered a warrant inducement agreement with an existing institutional investor to induce immediate exercise of August 2024 Series A and Series B warrants (each to purchase up to 1,692,308 ordinary shares) at a reduced exercise price of $1.00, generating approximately $3.4 million in gross proceeds (before fees and expenses). In a private placement, the investor will receive new Series A-1 warrants (to purchase up to 2,538,462 shares) and Series B-1 warrants (to purchase up to 2,538,462 shares) with an exercise price of $1.25, immediately exercisable. Series A-1 expires five years from issuance; Series B-1 expires 18 months from issuance. Closing is expected on or about Feb. 11, 2026, subject to customary conditions. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners is sole financial advisor. Proceeds are intended for working capital and general corporate purposes. The new warrants and underlying shares were offered in a private placement to accredited investors and Evogene plans to file a registration statement covering resale of shares issuable upon exercise.</p>
