      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Republic Power Group Limited (NASDAQ: RPGL) announced a 1-for-20 reverse share split of its Class A and Class B ordinary shares, effective at the open of business on February 23, 2026. Class A ordinary shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Nasdaq on that date, with a new par value of $0.0125 and a new CUSIP G7523E113. The reverse split will reduce issued and outstanding Class A shares from 62,025,000 to approximately 3.1 million (subject to fractional-share treatment). No fractional shares will be issued; fractional interests will be rounded up. The action is intended to regain compliance with Nasdaq's $1.00 minimum bid price requirement. Transhare Corporation is acting as exchange and paying agent; book-entry/brokerage holders need take no action. The company warns it cannot assure post-split share price will reflect the 1-for-20 ratio or remain above the pre-split trading price. The company also notes there is no public market for Class B ordinary shares.</p>
