      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Liminatus Pharma (NASDAQ: LIMN) priced a best-efforts public offering of 13,813,000 shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu) and warrants to purchase up to 20,719,500 shares at a combined public offering price of $0.29 per share (or $0.2899 per pre-funded warrant). The warrants have a $0.29 exercise price, are exercisable immediately and expire five years from issuance. Closing is expected on or about Feb. 18, 2026. Gross proceeds are expected to be approximately $4.0 million before fees and expenses, with potential additional proceeds of about $6.0 million if warrants are fully exercised.

The offering is made pursuant to a Form S-1 (File No. 333-293364) declared effective by the SEC on Feb. 13, 2026.</p>
