      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Innovation Beverage Group Ltd (NASDAQ: IBG) provided a corporate update on its proposed merger with BlockFuel Energy Inc. The companies remain on track to close the merger in Q1 2026, subject to approvals. Operationally, 10 wells are back in production and seven more are expected to be returned to production by month-end; BlockFuel expects first oil and gas sales in February 2026 with initial revenues anticipated before March 31, 2026. The combined strategy targets a vertically integrated business monetizing hydrocarbons via traditional sales and onsite gas-to-power digital infrastructure (including modular Bitcoin mining), which management believes can lower effective energy costs and create incremental cash flow per well. BlockFuel signed a Letter of Intent to acquire additional nearby producing fields adding ~4,000 contiguous acres. All milestones remain subject to customary closing conditions, financing, commodity, regulatory and operational risks.</p>
