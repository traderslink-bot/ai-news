      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Innovation Beverage Group (NASDAQ: IBG) issued a press release updating progress on its proposed merger with BlockFuel Energy (BFE) and operational milestones intended to establish a combined energy + digital-asset mining business. The companies remain on track to close the merger in Q1 2026, subject to approvals. Ten wells are back in production and seven more are expected by month-end; BFE expects first oil and gas sales in February 2026 and initial revenues before March 31, 2026. Management plans modular, wellhead-adjacent gas-to-power generation and co-located Bitcoin mining to create a dual revenue stream (traditional gas/oil sales plus digital-mining income), and BFE has an LOI to acquire ~4,000 contiguous acres to expand producing acreage. The release emphasizes potential cost advantages of onsite gas-to-power and the strategic rationale while noting forward-looking risks and financing/approval dependencies.</p>
