      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Digital Brands Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: DBGI) entered into letter agreements with certain holders of Common Share Purchase Warrants (issued under an S-1 declared effective Feb 11, 2025) that were set to expire Feb 17, 2026. The holders agreed to immediate exercise of a portion of Existing Warrants and to receive New Warrants exercisable at $0.66 per share through June 17, 2026. Holders exercised an aggregate 2,365,968 Existing Warrants for approximately $1.54 million in proceeds. The Company agreed to issue New Common Share Purchase Warrants (substantially similar to Existing Warrants except for expiration) entitling each holder to purchase up to 2,408,508 shares at $0.66 per share by June 17, 2026, and to file a Registration Statement on Form S-3 to register the shares issuable upon exercise by no later than Feb 27, 2026.</p>
