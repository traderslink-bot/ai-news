      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>This is a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Onconetix, Inc. dated February 12, 2026 reporting entry into a Share Exchange Agreement (dated February 11, 2026) among Onconetix (Buyer), Realbotix Corp. (Parent), Simulacra Corporation (Seller) and Realbotix, LLC (Company). Under the agreement Onconetix will acquire all issued and outstanding equity interests of Realbotix in exchange for newly issued Onconetix common stock. The number of Exchange Shares issued will result in the Seller owning a specified percentage of fully diluted Onconetix stock post-closing based on Net Cash at closing: 90% if Net Cash >= $12.5M and < $15.0M; 85% if >= $15.0M and < $18.0M; 80% if >= $18.0M and < $20.0M; and 75% if >= $20.0M. The Closing is conditioned on, among other things, Onconetix having at least $12.5 million in Net Cash at Closing, conversion of Company convertible securities prior to closing, entry into an equity line agreement (reasonably acceptable) providing up to $125 million in capacity, and conversion of Buyer preferred stock and certain amendments/terminations of Buyer options and warrants. The agreement includes customary closing conditions, covenants, termination rights (including deadlines of November 30, 2026 with limited extension to December 20, 2026), and specified termination/transaction fee provisions (e.g., $500,000 termination fee plus expense caps, and additional $1.5M in certain superior proposal scenarios). Onconetix will file a registration statement on Form S-4 (proxy/prospectus) and a press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The filing also describes Realbotix’s U.S.-manufactured AI-powered humanoid robotics business and related risk factors.</p>
