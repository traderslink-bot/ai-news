      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>urban-gro, Inc. (NASDAQ: UGRO) announced it has completed its merger to acquire 100% of Flash Sports and Media, Inc. Flash shareholders received unregistered shares of urban-gro common stock at closing (subject to Nasdaq Rule 5635(d) issuance limits) and unregistered non-voting preferred stock that will convert into common stock upon required stockholder approval. Upon conversion, the aggregate number of common shares to be issued to former Flash holders will equal Flash's agreed equity valuation divided by $3.23 (urban-gro closing price on Feb 17, 2026). The company says the transaction diversifies its business into sports media, live events, and experiential marketing, believes its stockholders' equity exceeds the Nasdaq $2.5 million threshold under Rule 5550(b)(2), and is awaiting formal confirmation from the Nasdaq Hearing Panel of regained compliance.</p>
