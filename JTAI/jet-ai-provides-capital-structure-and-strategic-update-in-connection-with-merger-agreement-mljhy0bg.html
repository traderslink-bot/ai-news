      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Jet.AI (NASDAQ: JTAI) announced an amendment to its merger agreement with flyExclusive (NYSE: FLYX) executed February 11, 2026. The amendment removes a closing condition that would have required Jet.AI to enter a securities purchase agreement with a third-party investor (including a warrant to purchase up to $50 million of a newly-designated preferred series); Jet.AI confirmed it has sufficient positive net working capital to meet the minimum cash closing condition without that financing and no longer has any preferred stock outstanding. The parties agreed not to proceed with the previously contemplated $50 million financing. flyExclusive consented to Jet.AI pursuing additional M&A opportunities so long as any such transactions would close only after the completion of the proposed merger. The proposed merger remains subject to customary closing conditions and may not be consummated.</p>
