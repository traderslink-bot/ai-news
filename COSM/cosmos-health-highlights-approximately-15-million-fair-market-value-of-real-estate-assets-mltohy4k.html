      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>This is a press release from Cosmos Health (NASDAQ: COSM) announcing management's estimate that its wholly owned real estate portfolio (Cana Laboratories manufacturing facility in Neo Iraklio and CosmoFarm logistics center in Peristeri, Athens) has a combined fair market value of approximately $15 million (land and buildings only; machinery/equipment excluded). The company notes this estimated value exceeds its market capitalization (~$13.5 million as of Feb 17, 2026) and highlights a significant discount to reported book value (stockholders' equity $23.1 million as of Q3 2025). Property details: Cana — ~54,000 sq ft land and ~35,700 sq ft constructed area, free of mortgage; CosmoFarm — ~29,100 sq ft logistics facility with automation/robotics. Cosmos is evaluating monetization options (sale, joint venture, sale-leaseback, or other arrangements) to unlock shareholder value; proceeds could be used for debt reduction, reinvestment, acquisitions, or shareholder actions. No transaction has been committed; outcomes depend on market and regulatory conditions.</p>
