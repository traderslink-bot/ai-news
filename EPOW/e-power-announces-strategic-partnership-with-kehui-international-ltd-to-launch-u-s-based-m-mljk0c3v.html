      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>E-Power (NASDAQ: EPOW) announced an MOU with Kehui International Ltd to form a U.S. joint venture, E-Power Grid Inc. USA, focused on microgrids for AI data centers, power equipment, and power automation. Under the MOU E-Power will be majority owner with at least a 55% stake and will provide $1.5 million in cash to fund initial registration and establishment. Kehui will contribute its proprietary "Synchronous Constant Frequency Microgrid" patents and technical support; the patent contribution value and investment ratio will be determined by a mutually recognized third-party appraisal. The JV has exclusive rights to use the contributed patent technology in the United States and Canada, includes a priority procurement clause for Kehui products, and contains performance-based milestones, including a $3 million cumulative sales target within the first three years to retain patent rights. Both parties will form a joint task force within 30 days to finalize registration, appraisals, and capital transfers.</p>
