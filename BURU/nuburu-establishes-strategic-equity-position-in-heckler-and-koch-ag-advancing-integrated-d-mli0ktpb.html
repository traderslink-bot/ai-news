      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>NUBURU, Inc. (NYSE: BURU) announced it has established a strategic equity position in Heckler & Koch AG (Euronext: MLHK) via a privately negotiated securities purchase agreement funded through the issuance of a subordinated convertible note. The move is intended to align NUBURU's directed-energy, optical countermeasure and software-orchestrated non-kinetic technologies with H&K's globally deployed kinetic platforms for layered defense architectures. Management says the companies are in senior-level discussions to explore technical, operational and regulatory alignment and potential expanded industrial cooperation. The transaction reinforces NUBURU's Defense & Security ecosystem (including Tekne, Orbit, Lyocon) and is detailed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Future cooperation remains subject to customary approvals and further evaluation.</p>
