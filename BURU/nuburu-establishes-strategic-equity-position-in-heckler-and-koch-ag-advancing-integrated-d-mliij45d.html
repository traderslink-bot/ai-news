      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>NUBURU, Inc. (NYSE: BURU) announced it has established a strategic equity position in Heckler & Koch AG (Euronext Paris: MLHK) via a privately negotiated securities purchase agreement, with consideration paid through issuance of a subordinated convertible note. NUBURU is engaging in senior-level strategic discussions with H&K to explore integrating NUBURU's directed-energy and optical countermeasure technologies with H&K's kinetic platforms for layered, multi-domain defense architectures. The companies may evaluate broader industrial cooperation subject to technical, operational and regulatory alignment. NUBURU says transaction details are included in a Current Report on Form 8-K.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Positives</strong>
      <ul><li>Positions NUBURU alongside a globally recognized defense OEM (Heckler & Koch) potentially accelerating integration of non-kinetic technologies with established kinetic platforms</li><li>Supports NUBURU's strategic transformation into a vertically integrated Defense & Security platform and expands its defense ecosystem (Tekne, Orbit, Lyocon)</li><li>Potential market and operational synergies if technical and regulatory alignment are achieved, which could open new defense contracting opportunities</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Negatives</strong>
      <ul><li>Transaction consideration was a subordinated convertible note, which could lead to future equity dilution if converted</li><li>Key financial terms and specifics of the equity stake were not disclosed in the press release</li><li>Any expanded cooperation is conditional on technical, operational and regulatory approvals and thus is uncertain</li><li>Forward-looking statements are subject to multiple risks (regulatory, financing, integration, market) as noted in the release</li></ul>
