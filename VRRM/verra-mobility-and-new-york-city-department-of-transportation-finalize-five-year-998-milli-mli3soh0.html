      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Verra Mobility (NASDAQ: VRRM) announced a new five-year, $998 million contract with the New York City Department of Transportation, effective January 1, 2026, to operate NYC's automated enforcement camera programs (red-light, speed, bus lane and BQE weight enforcement) with an option to extend for an additional five years. The agreement expands the red-light camera program to 600 signalized intersections (up from ~150) following 2025 state legislation, commits to upgrading legacy equipment, and includes a 33% utilization target for minority- and women-owned business enterprises plus community and workforce partnerships. The contract value is a 34% increase versus the prior five-year period (2021-2025) and follows a competitive RFP in which Verra was selected based on its technical capabilities.</p>
