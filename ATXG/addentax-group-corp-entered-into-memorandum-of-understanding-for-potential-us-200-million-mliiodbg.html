      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Addentax Group Corp. (Nasdaq: ATXG) announced non-binding MOUs dated Feb 9, 2026 with two institutional investors backed by a Middle Eastern royal family to explore a potential strategic equity investment of up to US$200 million (up to US$100 million per investor). Each investor intends to acquire newly issued common shares at a proposed fixed price of US$1.50 per share; definitive agreements are targeted to be negotiated and executed within six months and the transaction is subject to due diligence, corporate, regulatory and stock exchange approvals. The parties are also discussing strategic collaboration to advance ATXG's AI-driven financial technology and cryptocurrency financial services, with potential uses of proceeds including scaling platforms, expanding compliant crypto services, Hong Kong/APAC market penetration, and R&D investment. The company cautions there is no assurance the transaction will be completed.</p>
