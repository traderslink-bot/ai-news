      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Addentax Group Corp. (Nasdaq: ATXG) announced it is in late-stage negotiations to acquire a Hong Kong–based licensed digital lending platform operating under the Money Lenders Ordinance (Cap. 163). The target serves over 30,000 customers annually with historical loan approvals exceeding HK$2 billion and offers consumer and SME financing via an AI-enabled loan origination and algorithmic credit assessment platform. If completed and approved by regulators, the deal would give ATXG regulated lending operations, local licensing and origination infrastructure, AI-driven credit/risk tools, and potential capabilities to explore compliant digital asset–related lending applications to expand its fintech presence in the Asia-Pacific region. The transaction remains subject to completion, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.</p>
