      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>La Rosa Holdings (NASDAQ: LRHC) sold its 51% ownership interest in Horeb Kissimmee Realty LLC (LR Kissimmee) for $0.5 million, divesting a non-core, unprofitable office that represented roughly 10% of the company’s agent base. The company says the sale strengthens the balance sheet, eliminates an operating component that was not generating positive cash flow, and allows redeployment of capital toward core brokerage growth, technology development and ancillary services. La Rosa also entered a one-year, non-exclusive Trademark & Brand Licensing Agreement that permits LR Kissimmee continued use of La Rosa trademarks and access to the company’s technology platform, providing ongoing brand/platform-related revenue without majority ownership or capital commitment.</p>
