      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced a Special Meeting of shareholders to vote on the merger with Netflix on March 20, 2026 (8:00 a.m. ET) and has commenced mailing the definitive proxy statement. WBD's Board unanimously recommends shareholders vote FOR the Netflix merger and recommends rejecting Paramount Skydance's (PSKY) tender offer. Netflix granted WBD a seven-day waiver (through Feb 23, 2026) permitting WBD to engage with PSKY to seek clarity on outstanding deficiencies and solicit PSKY's best and final offer; PSKY reportedly informed WBD it would agree to pay $31 per share pending engagement and that $31 was not its "best and final." Netflix retains its matching rights under the merger agreement. WBD sent PSKY a letter and draft transaction agreements to confirm binding terms; WBD referenced its Schedule 14D-9 amendment and urged shareholders to review the proxy materials.</p>
