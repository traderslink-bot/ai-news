      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>HUB Cyber Security Ltd. (NASDAQ: HUBC) announced a term sheet to acquire 100% of Ferrox Critical Minerals Ltd. and its Tivani minerals project in South Africa.

The proposed transaction contemplates $125 million in equity consideration issued by HUB in four stages; upon execution of definitive agreements HUB would issue 19.9% of its outstanding shares in the first stage, with additional share issuances tied to three project performance milestones and subject to shareholder approval, due diligence, regulatory approvals and customary conditions. HUB positions the asset as a revenue-bearing anchor for its Trust Rails platform to extend its secured data/validation infrastructure into real-world asset validation. The release includes a detailed risk/forward-looking statement list.</p>
