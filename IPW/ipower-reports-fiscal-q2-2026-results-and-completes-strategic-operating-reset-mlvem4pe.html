      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release reporting iPower's fiscal Q2 (ended Dec 31, 2025) results: revenue $7.1M, gross profit $3.1M and gross margin 44.0%. Total operating expenses declined 28% YoY to $5.6M. Net loss attributable to iPower was $1.2M, or $(1.08) per share. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.0M, restricted cash $2.2M, and digital assets approximately $2.2M. Short-term debt declined to $2.6M; total debt approx. $8.4M, including $5.8M of convertible notes. During December 2025 the company implemented a Digital Asset Treasury strategy and closed the first tranche of an up to $30M convertible note offering, receiving $6.5M gross proceeds. Subsequent to quarter-end (Feb 2026) iPower divested Global Product Marketing Inc. for ~$2.3M and authorized a $2.0M share repurchase program. Management cites a deliberate supply-chain shift to predominantly U.S. sourcing and cost-structure reductions to improve long-term margins and reliability.</p>
