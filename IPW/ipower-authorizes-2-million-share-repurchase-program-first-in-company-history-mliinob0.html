      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>iPower Inc. (NASDAQ: IPW) announced that its Board of Directors approved the company's first-ever share repurchase program, authorizing up to $2.0 million in stock buybacks. The program has unified support from all of iPower's creditors. The company said the repurchase reflects improved balance sheet strength driven by new capital and recent cost-structure improvements, and that implementation will occur in the near future subject to market conditions and applicable regulations.</p>
