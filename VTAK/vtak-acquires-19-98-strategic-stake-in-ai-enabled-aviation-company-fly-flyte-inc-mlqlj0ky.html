      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Catheter Precision, Inc. (NYSE: VTAK) announced a strategic minority investment acquiring a 19.98% equity stake in Fly Flyte, Inc. (operating flight operations through subsidiary Ponderosa Air, LLC, FAA Air Carrier Certificate No. 1POA402M) which operates FAA Part 135 regional services with a fleet of Cirrus Vision Jets equipped with whole-aircraft parachute and Safe Return™ autonomous landing tech. Flyte is revenue-generating today and uses AI-enabled optimization for routing, pricing, dispatch and utilization. The transaction gives VTAK immediate exposure to an asset-backed, scalable regional air mobility business while preserving Flyte’s operating control and creating optionality for increased ownership or future monetization. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions, including shareholder approval; additional details are referenced in VTAK’s Form 8-K filed Feb 6, 2026.</p>
