      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release: Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) announced it closed a previously announced US$10.5 million equity investment from Enduring Wealth Capital Limited (EWCL) via issuance of 7,000,000 Class B ordinary shares at US$1.50 per share (20 votes per share). EWCL's beneficial ownership rose from ~2.81% to ~4.71% of total shares and its voting power increased from ~36.68% to ~49.71%. Cango also entered definitive agreements for additional Class A investments totaling US$65 million from entities wholly owned by Chairman Xin Jin (Armada Network Limited, ANL) and director Chang-Wei Chiu (Fortune Peak Limited, FPL): ANL to subscribe for 19,267,287 Class A shares for US$25,432,819 and FPL to subscribe for 29,975,137 Class A shares for US$39,567,181 (implied price US$1.32/share). Upon closing, Mr. Chiu would hold ~11.99% of outstanding shares (~6.71% voting power) and Mr. Jin ~4.70% of shares (~2.63% voting power). Proceeds are intended to support expansion into AI and computing infrastructure and to strengthen the balance sheet. Closings of the Class A investments are subject to customary conditions, including NYSE approvals, and are expected in February 2026 but not guaranteed.</p>
