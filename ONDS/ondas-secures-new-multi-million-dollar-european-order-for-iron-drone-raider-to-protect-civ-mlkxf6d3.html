      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Ondas Inc. (NASDAQ: ONDS) announced that its subsidiary Airobotics received a new multi-million dollar order from a major European customer in a NATO country for the Iron Drone Raider counter-UAS system. The award follows an operational deployment of the system at a major European international airport tied to a separate contract from the same customer and complements prior orders (totaling $16.8 million) to protect two major European airports. Company highlights Iron Drone Raider’s net-based kinetic interception as a civil-compliant alternative to RF jamming or ballistic interceptors and positions Ondas, together with Sentrycs and Insight Intelligent Sensors, to offer an integrated detection-to-interception solution for civil infrastructure protection.</p>
