      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Psyence BioMed (NASDAQ: PBM) announced that Psyence Labs Ltd. (PsyLabs) exercised a previously disclosed put option, triggering a share-for-share equity investment. PsyLabs will issue 2,900 PsyLabs shares to Psyence BioMed valued at US$5,000,000 (valuation basis US$1,724 per PsyLabs share). In exchange, Psyence BioMed will issue 1,146,159 common shares to PsyLabs (calculated using a 30-day VWAP of US$4.36). No cash will change hands. Following issuance, PsyLabs is expected to beneficially own approximately 49.98% of Psyence BioMed (based on 1,147,148 common shares outstanding prior to issuance). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and expected to close on or about February 25, 2026. A Special Committee of independent directors reviewed and ratified the transaction; certain company executives provide consulting services to PsyLabs and collectively own less than 13% of PsyLabs. Management frames the deal as strengthening supply and manufacturing alignment for Psyence BioMed's psilocybin and ibogaine development programs.</p>
