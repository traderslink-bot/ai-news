      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Envoy Medical (NASDAQ: COCH) priced an upsized public offering consisting of 75,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (or pre-funded warrants) together with Series A-1 warrants to purchase up to 45,000,000 shares and Series A-2 warrants to purchase up to 75,000,000 shares, at a combined public offering price of $0.40 per share (or pre-funded warrant) and accompanying warrants. The offering is expected to close on or about Feb. 12, 2026, with H.C. Wainwright & Co. as placement agent. Aggregate gross proceeds to the company at closing are expected to be approximately $30.0 million before fees, with potential additional gross proceeds of approximately $48.0 million if the warrants are fully exercised for cash following required stockholder approval and milestone events tied to FDA PMA submission and approval for the Acclaim cochlear implant. Envoy intends to use net proceeds for working capital and to fund operations during its FDA pivotal clinical study. The securities are offered under a registration statement on Form S-1 that was declared effective Feb. 11, 2026.</p>
