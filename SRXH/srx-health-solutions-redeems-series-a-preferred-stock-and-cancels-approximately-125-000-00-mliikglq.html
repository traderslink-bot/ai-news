      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>SRx Health Solutions announced the redemption of 17,500 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock, which represents approximately 125,000,000 shares of common stock on an as-converted basis. The Series A was issued in a private placement on October 31, 2025 (19,035 shares for aggregate proceeds of ~$15.23 million). Management says the retirement of the preferred and cancellation of the as-converted common shares improves capital structure flexibility for future investments or potential return of capital. The company expects to file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2025 on February 13, 2026 and noted it has no immediate undisclosed M&A plans. The release includes customary forward-looking statements and associated risks.</p>
