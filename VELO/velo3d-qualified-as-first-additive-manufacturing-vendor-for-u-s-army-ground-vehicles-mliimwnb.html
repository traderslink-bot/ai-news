      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Velo3D (NASDAQ: VELO) was selected as the first qualified additive manufacturing (AM) vendor to support the U.S. Army DEVCOM Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC) as part of a CRADA to accelerate qualified AM solutions across the Defense Industrial Base. Velo3D met GVSC qualification criteria in under two weeks and will validate critical components on its Sapphire family of metal AM printers in Aluminum CP1 and Inconel 718. Upon successful validation, Velo3D’s AM alternatives will be available to Army TACOM for insertion into the Army supply chain to address sustainment bottlenecks. The company highlights large-format build capability (up to 600mm diameter, 1m height), in-situ process monitoring, U.S. assembly, and DoD cybersecurity compliance. No financial terms or timelines for insertion were disclosed.</p>
