      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release: AtlasClear Holdings (NYSE: ATCH) reported fiscal Q2 (ended Dec 31, 2025) revenue of $5.1M, up 84% YoY, and net income of $6.8M (driven in part by non-cash fair value adjustments). Stockholders' equity turned positive to $21.7M (vs. a $(6.8)M deficit on June 30, 2025; ~+$59.8M vs FY-end 2024). Cash and restricted cash totaled $46.2M (cash & cash equivalents $23.1M); total assets $77.6M. Wilson-Davis & Co. ended the quarter with net capital of $14.7M. The company completed a $20M financing in the quarter ($10M secured convertible note and $10M equity units). Expenses rose with revenue (higher variable compensation, clearing/data processing costs, and stock-based compensation). Management says proceeds plus expected operating cash flows provide sufficient liquidity for at least the next 12 months. Company continues platform development and is progressing toward a proposed acquisition of Commercial Bancorp of Wyoming, subject to regulatory approvals. Earnings call scheduled Feb 13, 2026 at 8:30 AM ET.</p>
