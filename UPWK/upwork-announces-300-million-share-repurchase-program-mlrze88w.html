      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ: UPWK) announced that its board approved a new $300 million share repurchase authorization. Repurchases may be executed on the open market (including 10b5-1 plans), in privately negotiated transactions, via accelerated share repurchase programs, or by other methods at the company’s discretion; the authorization has no expiration but does not obligate any repurchases and may be suspended, terminated, or modified. The announcement follows $136 million deployed in 2025 to repurchase more than 9 million shares and was framed as a capital return amid reported record 2025 results and a plan to accelerate GSV and revenue growth.</p>
