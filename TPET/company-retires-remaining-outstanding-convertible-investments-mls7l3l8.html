      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Trio Petroleum Corp (NYSE American: TPET) announced that on Feb 13, 2026 it fully converted $1.2 million aggregate principal of convertible promissory notes (issued in Aug 2025 to three institutional investors) into common stock. The shares issued upon conversion were registered for resale under a registration statement filed Sept 4, 2025 and declared effective Sept 11, 2025. The Notes have been retired. The company says this improves its cash position and strengthens the balance sheet. Trio also stated it is bringing newly acquired Alberta assets online this week and reworking Saskatchewan wells to drive near-term cash flow.</p>
