      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release: EON Resources (NYSE: EONR) announced it increased its oil hedging coverage to 60% of current production for the balance of 2026 and 50% for Q1 2027, using futures-based contracts (primarily swaps) locked in after recent price spikes. The recent swaps provide an average price greater than $60.00 per barrel. EON is an independent upstream company with ~20,000 leasehold acres in the Permian, ~750 producing and injection wells producing over 1,000 barrels of oil per day, and highlighted proven reserves at the Grayburg-Jackson Field of ~14.0 million barrels of oil and 2.8 Bcf gas (December 2024 report). Management stated the hedges position the company for potential banking needs, acquisitions and growth, and that up to ~92 horizontal wells may be drilled under a farmout over the next several years. The release includes forward-looking statement disclaimers.</p>
