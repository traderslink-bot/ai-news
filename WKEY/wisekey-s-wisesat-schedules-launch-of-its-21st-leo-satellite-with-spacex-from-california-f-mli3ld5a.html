      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>WISeKey (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY) announced that its subsidiary WISeSat.Space Corp. plans to launch its 21st LEO satellite with SpaceX from California at the end of March 2026. WISeSat will embed WISeKey's Root of Trust, SEALSQ's post-quantum chip and the SEALCOIN wallet onboard in partnership with SEALSQ (NASDAQ: LAES) and SEALCOIN.AI to advance a quantum-secure satellite IoT network and enable device-to-device token transactions using Hedera-backed SEALCOIN. The launch is described as the first operational deployment of a new generation of WISeSat satellites; the company plans multiple launches in 2026–27, aims to integrate AI-driven analytics and hybrid terrestrial-satellite architectures, and anticipates a NASDAQ listing for WISeSat via a business combination with Columbus Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: COLA) to accelerate constellation deployment. The release contains forward-looking statements and outlines technology, security and commercialization goals.</p>
