      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NRGV) announced a proposed private placement of $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due March 1, 2031, with an option for initial purchasers to buy an additional $25.0 million. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations, pay interest semiannually, and conversion will be settled in cash, shares, or a combination at the company's election. Expected uses of proceeds include entering into capped call transactions, redeeming $35.0 million to $45.0 million aggregate principal of senior unsecured convertible debentures issued to YA II PN, Ltd., and general corporate purposes (which may include repayment of additional indebtedness and growth initiatives). The company expects to enter capped call transactions to reduce potential dilution; option counterparties and their affiliates may hedge by trading Company stock or derivatives, which could affect the market price. The offering will be made only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and the securities will not be registered under the Securities Act.</p>

      <ul><li>Raises up to $125M (plus $25M option) to fund operations and strategic actions</li><li>Proceeds intended to redeem $35M–$45M of YA II PN, Ltd. convertible debentures, reducing that specific debt exposure</li><li>Use of capped call transactions intended to limit dilution on conversion</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Negatives</strong>
      <ul><li>Notes are senior unsecured obligations (no collateral)</li><li>Conversion could still dilute existing shareholders if capped calls and other offsets are insufficient</li><li>Hedging and derivative activity by option counterparties may increase price volatility of the common stock</li><li>Offering is private (Rule 144A) and notes/shares are not registered, limiting investor pool</li></ul>
