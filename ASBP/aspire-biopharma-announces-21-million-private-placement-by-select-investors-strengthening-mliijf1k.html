      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Aspire Biopharma (NASDAQ: ASBP) entered a Securities Purchase Agreement on Feb 6, 2026 to sell up to 26,250 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares at $800 each for gross proceeds up to $21.0 million. The company completed an initial closing on Feb 6 issuing 13,750 Preferred Shares for $11.0 million gross. Preferred Shares are convertible into common stock. Proceeds will be used to repay legacy indebtedness, support operations, fund strategic initiatives and pay offering expenses; a second closing is expected subject to customary conditions. RBW Capital Partners LLC (through Dawson James Securities) acted as sole placement agent. The securities are unregistered, offered only to accredited investors, and the company expects to file registration statements covering resale of shares issuable upon conversion. Aspire says the Offering should help regain Nasdaq stockholders’ equity listing compliance and strengthen the balance sheet to support development initiatives.</p>
