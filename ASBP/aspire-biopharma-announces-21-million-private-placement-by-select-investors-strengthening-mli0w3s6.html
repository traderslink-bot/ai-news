      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Aspire Biopharma (NASDAQ: ASBP) entered a securities purchase agreement on Feb 6, 2026 to sell up to 26,250 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at $800 each for aggregate gross proceeds up to $21.0 million. The company completed an initial closing on Feb 6, issuing 13,750 preferred shares for $11.0 million gross; proceeds will be used to repay legacy indebtedness, support operations, fund strategic initiatives and pay offering expenses. The offering is intended to help Aspire regain compliance with Nasdaq stockholders' equity listing requirements and strengthen its balance sheet; a second closing is expected but remains subject to customary conditions. RBW Capital Partners LLC acted as sole placement agent, and the company filed a Form 8-K disclosing the transaction and intends to file registration statements covering resale of shares issuable upon conversion.</p>
