      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Aspire Biopharma Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASBP) announced on February 20, 2026 that Nasdaq has confirmed the company regained compliance with the minimum stockholders' equity requirement of $2.5 million under Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). The company had previously announced restoration of compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) on February 10, 2026. Aspire's common stock will remain listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq also notified Aspire it will remain subject to a Panel Monitor under Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B) for one year through February 18, 2027; failure to maintain compliance during that period would require the company to request a hearing before the Panel rather than submit a compliance plan.</p>
