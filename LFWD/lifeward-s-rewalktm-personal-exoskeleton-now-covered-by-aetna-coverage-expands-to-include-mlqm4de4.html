      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Lifeward Ltd. (NASDAQ: LFWD) announced that Aetna has issued a prior authorization for a Medicare Advantage beneficiary to obtain the FDA‑approved ReWalk Personal Exoskeleton for a qualifying individual with spinal cord injury. With prior authorizations already issued by UnitedHealthcare and Humana, three of the largest Medicare Advantage insurers now have approved the device for beneficiaries who meet medical necessity criteria, representing roughly 16 million Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Lifeward highlights peer‑reviewed evidence of clinical benefits and frames the insurer decisions as expanded access that may support adoption; the release also includes standard forward‑looking statements and notes ongoing insurer, clinician and provider engagement.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Negatives</strong>
      <ul><li>Approvals are prior authorizations for individual beneficiaries who meet medical necessity criteria, not a universal or national Medicare (CMS) coverage determination.</li><li>Coverage remains conditional and case‑by‑case; prior authorization does not guarantee broad or consistent reimbursement across all plans or beneficiaries.</li><li>Press release contains forward‑looking statements and references to proposed transactions and other risks, indicating uncertainty about future outcomes and commercial impacts.</li></ul>
