      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Immunic (NASDAQ: IMUX) announced a private placement priced at market under Nasdaq rules for up to $400 million, led by BVF Partners with participation from multiple institutional investors. Upfront gross proceeds of $200 million will be raised through issuance of 229,076,000 pre-funded warrants at $0.873 each; the company may raise an additional up to $200 million via warrants to purchase up to 229,076,000 shares (or pre-funded warrants in lieu) at an exercise price of $0.873. Warrants expire the earlier of 30 days after public announcement of top-line ENSURE Phase 3 data or February 17, 2031. The financing is expected to close on or about February 17, 2026. Proceeds, together with existing cash, are expected to fund completion of the Phase 3 ENSURE trials in relapsing MS, initiation of a Phase 3 program in primary progressive MS, NDA preparation with expected submission mid-2027 and potential approval in 2028, and the company’s transition toward commercialization (runway into late 2027). Concurrent corporate changes: Simona Skerjanec elevated to interim Chairperson, Thor Nagel (BVF) joins the board, and CEO Dr. Daniel Vitt will lead the search for a commercially experienced CEO while transitioning to a senior scientific role. Immunic also entered a purchase-and-sale agreement to cancel certain May 2025 Series B warrants in exchange for rights to a portion of an aggregate 5% royalty on future net sales of vidofludimus calcium; that agreement is expected to close around February 17, 2026. Leerink Partners acted as lead placement agent; several other firms served as placement agents.</p>
