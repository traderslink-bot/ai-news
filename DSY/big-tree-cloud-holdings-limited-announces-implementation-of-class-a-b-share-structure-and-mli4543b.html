      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Big Tree Cloud Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: DSY) announced shareholder approval of a 1-for-20 share consolidation (reverse stock split) and the adoption of a dual-class (Class A/Class B) share structure. The Company's Class A ordinary shares are expected to begin trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol DSY with a new CUSIP (G1263B132) at the open on February 12, 2026. The consolidation rounded fractional shares up to whole shares; authorised share capital was reallocated to 20,000,000 Class A and 5,000,000 Class B ordinary shares. Existing issued ordinary shares were redesignated (including 3,500,000 issued shares redesignated as Class B held by Ploutos Group), and outstanding options/warrants will be adjusted per their terms. The company said the changes aim to strengthen its market position and provide management stability as it pursues growth and AI initiatives.</p>
