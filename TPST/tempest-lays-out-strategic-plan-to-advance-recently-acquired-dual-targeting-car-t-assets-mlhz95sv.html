      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Tempest Therapeutics (NASDAQ: TPST) published a post-transaction strategic plan to advance a newly acquired portfolio of dual-targeting CAR-T and oncology assets using a capital-efficient, partner-funded approach. The company will prioritize TPST-2003, a dual-targeting CD19/BCMA CAR-T, with ongoing Phase 1 data expected from China and a planned registrational Phase 2b initiation in China by end-2026 and interim data in 2027 (development in China funded by a strategic partner). Tempest disclosed TPST-4003, an in vivo CD19/BCMA program intended to move the biology into a scalable modality and to be advanced via preclinical work and potential partner-funded investigator-initiated trials. Amezalpat is positioned as Phase 3-ready in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma with business-development pursued for pivotal development. TPST-1495 is slated for an NCI-funded Phase 2 in familial adenomatous polyposis with first patient expected in Q1 2026. The company also plans to progress additional next-generation CAR-T candidates (TPST-3003, TPST-2206, TPST-3206). The release emphasizes reliance on external funding/partners and lists typical clinical, funding and regulatory risks.</p>
