      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Tempest Therapeutics (NASDAQ: TPST) announced a capital-efficient post-transaction plan to advance its newly acquired CAR-T portfolio by prioritizing partner-funded and externally supported development. Near-term focus is on TPST-2003, a dual-targeting CD19/BCMA CAR-T with ongoing Phase 1 data expected from China, and a registrational Phase 2b in China targeted by end of 2026 with interim data in 2027 (China development funded by a strategic partner). Tempest disclosed TPST-4003, an in vivo CD19/BCMA program intended to be advanced via preclinical work and a potential partner-funded investigator-initiated trial. The company intends to pursue business development for amezalpat (Phase 3-ready in first-line HCC) and to advance TPST-1495 into a Phase 2 FAP study expected to enroll first patient in Q1 2026 (anticipated NCI funding). Additional next-generation programs (allogeneic and CD70-targeting constructs) are planned. The release reiterates standard forward-looking risks including need for additional capital, uncertainty of partner or NCI funding, clinical and regulatory risks, and possible operational or enrollment delays.</p>
