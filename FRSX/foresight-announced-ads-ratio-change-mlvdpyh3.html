      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Foresight Autonomous Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq and TASE: FRSX) announced it will change its ADS ratio from 1 ADS = 30 Ordinary Shares to 1 ADS = 90 Ordinary Shares, effective February 26, 2026. The exchange will be automatic for uncertificated ADSs in DRS and DTC; holders of certificated ADSs must surrender ADSs to BNY Mellon for cancellation and will receive one new ADS for every three existing ADSs. Ordinary Shares, shareholder ownership percentages and voting power will not change. ADSs will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol FRSX with a new CUSIP. The company will file a post-effective amendment on Form F-6. The company expects the ADS price to increase proportionally but gives no assurance, and fractional entitlements will be aggregated and sold for cash (net of fees, taxes and expenses).</p>
