      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Aqua Metals (NASDAQ: AQMS) entered into a term sheet to acquire Lion Energy, a U.S. energy storage systems and software company that reported approximately $50 million in 2025 revenue. The proposed all-stock transaction would issue about $25.8 million of Aqua Metals capital stock to Lion owners at closing, plus up to $65 million in additional Aqua Metals shares contingent on Lion Energy's revenue and EBITDA in the 12 months after closing. Lion would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary with its management retained. Aqua Metals says the deal would vertically integrate energy storage systems, proprietary energy management software, battery manufacturing links (including Lion's minority stake in American Battery Factory), and recycling to create a full-lifecycle battery platform. The transaction is subject to due diligence, definitive agreements, regulatory and shareholder approvals and aims to close in Q2 2026.</p>

      <strong>Negatives</strong>
      <ul><li>All-stock structure will dilute existing Aqua Metals shareholders and could dilute further via up to $65M contingent share issuance</li><li>Transaction is subject to customary conditions—due diligence, audit, definitive agreement, regulatory review and Aqua Metals shareholder approval</li><li>Integration risk combining hardware, software and recycling operations could impact near-term operations and results</li><li>Contingent consideration tied to post-close revenue/EBITDA creates execution risk for Lion and additional dilution if targets are met</li><li>No guarantee the transaction will close on proposed Q2 2026 timeline or at all</li></ul>
