      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>GNK Holdings LLC and Marcus Lemonis delivered a letter to the Special Committee of BARK, Inc. (NYSE: BARK) reiterating a non-binding, all-cash take-private indication of interest at $1.10 per share (a 22% premium to a previously announced related-party $0.90 per share CEO proposal). The Group says the Special Committee has not engaged in substantive discussions, criticizes a proposed NDA/standstill from BARK's counsel, refuses to sign it, and demands a response. The Group intends to make the letter public and states its view that its proposal best maximizes shareholder value. The proposal remains non-binding and subject to customary approvals and financing.</p>
