      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Udemy announced an integration with OpenAI that embeds a Udemy app inside ChatGPT, enabling users to discover, preview, and interact with Udemy courses (including in-chat video, assessments, hands-on labs, and structured learning journeys) directly within ChatGPT conversations. The feature is available to logged-in ChatGPT users across Free, Go, Plus, and Pro tiers, launched in English with subtitle support, and includes enhanced tracking and learning-journey intelligence for existing Udemy customers. The partnership aims to expand distribution and lower discovery friction for Udemy's 290,000-course catalog while emphasizing validated skill development rather than generic LLM tutoring. The release contains forward-looking statements and notes risks around implementation, adoption, platform changes, and monetization.</p>
