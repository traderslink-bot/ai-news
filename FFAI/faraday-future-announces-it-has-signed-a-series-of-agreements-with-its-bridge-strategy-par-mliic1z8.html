      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Faraday Future (NASDAQ: FFAI) announced it signed a package of seven agreements with bridge strategy partner Hebei Huanzhou Automobile Sales Co., Ltd. to advance development, mass-production-oriented parts procurement, engineering services, IP licensing and scaled deliveries of the FX Super One battery-electric MPV for the U.S. market. The agreements aim to stabilize the supply chain, lower parts costs, support the Company’s multi-stage start-of-delivery (SOD) milestones in 2026, and could enable negotiation of additional projects (including the FX 4) and geographic expansion to Canada and the Middle East. The release reiterates the Company’s goal to improve cash flow but highlights forward-looking risks including financing needs, regulatory/homologation, production and operational uncertainties.</p>
