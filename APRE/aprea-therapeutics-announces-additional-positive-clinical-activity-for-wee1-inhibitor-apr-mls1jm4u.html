      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>This is a press release reporting preliminary Phase 1 ACESOT-1051 data for Aprea Therapeutics' (NASDAQ: APRE) WEE1 inhibitor APR-1051. The company reported a second unconfirmed partial response (PR) at the first on-treatment scan in an advanced endometrial cancer patient in the 220 mg cohort, with 50% tumor shrinkage by RECIST v1.1 and an 87% reduction in CA-125; the tumor harbored a PPP2R1A mutation and the patient experienced only Grade 1 adverse events. To date 22 patients have been treated (doses 10 mg–220 mg), with two unconfirmed PRs observed (at 150 mg and 220 mg) and five patients with stable disease across multiple cohorts. Enrollment in the 220 mg cohort continues, the company plans to expand PPP2R1A endometrial and HPV-positive HNSCC cohorts, and a further update is expected in Q2 2026.</p>
