      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>OLB Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: OLB) entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor to sell 2,857,142 shares of common stock (or prefunded warrants) plus warrants to purchase up to 3,571,428 shares, at a combined purchase price of $1.05 per share/unit. The new warrants have a $0.92 exercise price, become exercisable after effectiveness of a resale registration statement, and will have a five-year term measured from effectiveness of that registration statement. The company also agreed to reduce the exercise price of certain existing warrants (issued Aug 23, 2021 and Nov 8, 2021) to $0.92 and extend their term by three years. Gross proceeds are expected to be approximately $3.0 million before commissions and expenses. Closing is expected on or about February 19, 2026, subject to customary conditions. D. Boral Capital LLC is acting as exclusive placement agent. The sale is a private placement relying on Section 4(a)(2)/Regulation D and is subject to resale registration rights the company agreed to file with the SEC.</p>
