      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release summarizing market-moving small- and mid-cap developments: Interactive Strength (TRNR) agreed to acquire Ergatta, raising TRNR's 2026 pro forma revenue guidance by ~50% to >$30M; Ergatta is expected to generate >$10M in 2026 revenue with ~30% EBITDA margins, and the deal has a performance-linked EV cap of $19.5M (50% tied to 2026 EBITDA of ~$4M) with closing targeted for Q1 2026. Kraig Biocraft Laboratories (KBLB) activated the first wave of its 2026 production program, moving biomaterials to incubation and commencing a March production run as part of a multi-ton recombinant spider silk scale-up. Theriva Biologics (TOVX) out-licensed SYN-020 to Rasayana Therapeutics for GI/metabolic/inflammatory indications for $300K upfront, up to $38M in milestones and tiered single-digit royalties; Rasayana assumes development and commercialization costs. NorthStrive Biosciences (a PMGC/ELAB subsidiary) filed 10 U.S. patent applications expanding EL-22/EL-32 technologies into animal health and agriculture. The release is a paid editorial from 24/7 Market News, which discloses holding KBLB shares and receiving compensation.</p>
