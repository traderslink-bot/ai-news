      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Aehr Test Systems announced an initial production purchase order from a lead hyperscale data center customer for multiple Sonoma ultra-high-power package-level test and burn-in systems to support that customer's next-generation, higher-power AI accelerator ASICs. Deliveries of systems, turnkey burn-in modules and device-specific sockets are scheduled for summer 2026. Aehr says the customer is forecasting large Sonoma system purchases in the second half of 2026 and into 2027, which could expand Aehr's installed base and consumable revenue. The release positions Aehr as a provider of high-power, multi-zone thermal burn-in solutions for advanced AI processors but includes forward-looking statements and typical execution and timing risks.</p>
