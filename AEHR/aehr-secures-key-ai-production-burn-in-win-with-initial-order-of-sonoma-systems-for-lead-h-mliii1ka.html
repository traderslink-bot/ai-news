      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ: AEHR) announced an initial production purchase order from a lead hyperscale data center customer for multiple Sonoma ultra-high-power package-level test and burn-in systems to support that customer's next-generation, higher-power AI ASIC processors. Systems, turnkey burn-in modules, and device-specific sockets are scheduled for delivery in summer 2026. Aehr says the customer's current-generation processor is already ramping and forecasts significant Sonoma system purchases in H2 2026 and into 2027, potentially expanding Aehr's installed base and consumable revenue. The Sonoma platform targets extreme power density, high-current delivery, and multi-zone thermal management required by advanced AI processors.</p>
