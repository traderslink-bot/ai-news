      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>SEGG Media Corporation (NASDAQ: SEGG; LTRYW) announced the closing of its previously disclosed acquisition of a controlling interest in Veloce Media Group, valuing Veloce at approximately $61 million (£45 million). The deal was completed with a mix of cash and SEGG shares priced at $10 per share. Management projects the acquisition will add more than $20 million in incremental annual revenue, which SEGG Media will begin recognizing and reporting in Q1. The company said the acquisition expands its global digital media footprint (including Sports.com, Concerts.com, and Lottery.com), diversifies revenue, consolidates operating results, and aims to improve its revenue-to-market-cap profile. The release includes customary forward-looking risk disclosures regarding internal controls, capital resources, going concern, Nasdaq compliance, and becoming current with SEC filings.</p>
