      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>HCW Biologics (NASDAQ: HCWB) and WY Biotech formed Beijing Trimmune Biotech Co., Ltd. ("Trimmune") and closed the first round of financing led by CITIC Medical Fund and TigerYeah Capital Fund of TigerMed. Trimmune obtained an exclusive worldwide license for HCW11-006 (re-coded TB006 in China) and an option to license Greater China rights to HCW9302 for additional consideration. Consideration to HCW Biologics includes a $3.5 million upfront license fee (half paid today: $1,750,000; remainder due on or before March 6, 2026) plus a minority co-founder equity position in Trimmune currently valued at approximately $3.5 million (combined value ≈ $7.0 million). HCW is eligible for development milestone payments, double-digit royalties, and a share of proceeds from future transactions. Trimmune expects to initiate a Phase 1 trial in China for HCW11-006 in H1 2027; Trimmune will fund Phase 1. HCW retains a payment-free, milestone-free, royalty-free option to recapture rights in the Americas (U.S., Canada, Central and South America) after completion of the China Phase 1, with co-development arrangements if exercised.</p>
