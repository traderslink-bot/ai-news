      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>N2OFF, Inc. (NASDAQ: NITO) announced that its wholly owned subsidiary MitoCareX Bio reported preliminary in vitro data showing certain MITOLINE™-discovered small-molecule candidates reduced key pro‑inflammatory markers in human immune cell assays. The company says the MITOLINE™ sequence‑based platform enables 3D comparative models of mitochondrial carrier proteins for virtual screening and identification of novel scaffolds. MitoCareX plans to pursue in vivo validation, lead optimization, and preclinical development across inflammatory metabolic disease indications. N2OFF reiterated ownership of MitoCareX (100%) and highlighted market projections for anti‑inflammatory and metabolic disorder therapeutics. The release contains customary forward‑looking statements and risk disclaimers, including funding and regulatory uncertainties.</p>
