      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>American Rebel Holdings (NASDAQ: AREB; warrants AREBW) announced its board will not appeal Nasdaq's delisting determination and will pursue a structured transition to the OTC Markets (initially seeking quotation on OTCID with a goal of upgrading to OTCQB). The company will remain a fully reporting SEC filer. Nasdaq found the company out of compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price rule after the shares closed below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days (Dec 17, 2025–Jan 30, 2026) and cited prior reverse stock splits (four splits since Oct 2024, cumulative 1-for-90,000) that preclude a compliance period; Nasdaq plans to suspend trading and file Form 25 to delist, with suspension expected at market open Feb 13, 2026. The release reiterates recent operating actions (acquisition of Champion Safe, expansion of the Beverage Division) and restates financials from the 10-Q: nine months ended Sep 30, 2025 revenue $7.23M; net loss $(28.43)M; accumulated deficit $(93.51)M; working capital deficit $(17.65)M; cash $722K; restricted cash $2.62M; total liabilities $28.37M. Management signals intent to strengthen fundamentals, access capital, and pursue relisting when feasible, while warning of typical risks (reduced liquidity, penny-stock rules, high interest debt, and going-concern uncertainty).</p>
