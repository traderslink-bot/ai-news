      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>American Rebel Holdings filed a formal appeal with Nasdaq on February 11, 2026, preserving its Nasdaq listing and allowing common stock (AREB) and warrants (AREBW) to continue trading while a Nasdaq Hearings Panel reviews the delisting determination. Nasdaq's February 4 determination cited failure to maintain a $1.00 minimum bid for 30 consecutive business days and disqualified the company from the usual cure period because of multiple reverse splits (cumulative 1-for-90,000). The company reversed an earlier decision not to appeal after stockholder engagement, plans to present a compliance plan at the hearing, and retains contingency plans to transition to the OTC Markets if the appeal fails.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Positives</strong>
      <ul><li>Timely appeal filed (Feb 11, 2026) which automatically stays any suspension or delisting while the hearing is pending, keeping AREB and AREBW trading on Nasdaq.</li><li>Management and Board reversed course based on stockholder feedback and are actively pursuing options to preserve investor value.</li><li>Company intends to present a compliance plan to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel and continues executing business strategy while the appeal proceeds.</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Negatives</strong>
      <ul><li>Nasdaq Staff determined delisting due to failure to maintain a $1.00 minimum bid for 30 consecutive business days (Rule 5550(a)(2)).</li><li>Company conducted multiple reverse stock splits (four since Oct 2024) with a cumulative ratio of 1-for-90,000, making it ineligible for the standard 180‑day cure period under Nasdaq rules.</li><li>Prior indication that the company would not appeal and prepare to move to the OTC introduced uncertainty and highlights governance/strategy instability.</li><li>If the appeal fails, a transition to OTC Markets could materially reduce liquidity and visibility for investors.</li></ul>
