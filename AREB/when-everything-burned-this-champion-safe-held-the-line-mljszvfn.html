      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release from Champion Safe Company (a subsidiary of American Rebel Holdings, Inc. - NASDAQ: AREB) describing a real-world incident in which a Champion Medalist 41 safe survived a near-total house fire and preserved irreplaceable items. The company highlights product design (one-hour fire rating, sealing, layered construction), recounts that the damaged safe will be replaced at no charge, and promotes the current Challenger series as the closest comparable model. The release also contains investor-forward statements noting ongoing Nasdaq delisting risk (Staff Delisting Determination dated Feb 4, 2026), the company’s appeal/request for a hearing, prior reverse stock splits (cumulative 1-for-90,000), potential dilution from convertible preferred stock, and other standard risk factors.</p>
