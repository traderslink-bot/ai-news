      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release: American Rebel Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AREB) announced an exclusive distribution agreement with Wil Fischer Distributing to expand American Rebel Light Beer's presence across south-central, southeast and northwest Missouri. The Wil Fischer territory reaches roughly 900,000 residents and includes markets such as Springfield, Branson and the Ozarks corridor; the partnership includes planned brand activation at the 9,000-seat Black Oak Amphitheater in spring 2026. American Rebel is also promoting a limited-edition 250th Anniversary "Patriot Pack" (shipping mid-May 2026) and is accepting distributor pre-orders. The company highlights its Distributor-First expansion strategy and notes its product positioning (light all-malt lager with low calories/carbs and ~4.2% ABV). The release discloses corporate actions and risks, including a 1-for-20 reverse stock split completed Feb 2, 2026 and receipt of a Nasdaq delisting notice with an anticipated appeal.</p>
