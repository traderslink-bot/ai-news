      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release (Feb 19, 2026): Jiuzi Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: JZXN) announced that after completing a $60 million initial strategic private financing on Feb 13, 2026, it is in discussions with existing and potential institutional investors to expand the private placement up to $100 million at a price of no less than $2.00 per share. The proposed additional funds are expected to be injected in the form of equivalent crypto assets to expand the company’s Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), strengthen digital asset reserves, optimize asset allocation and governance, accelerate on-chain application deployment, and leverage partner institutions’ technical and risk-management expertise. Terms including final scale, lock-ups and asset delivery methods remain under discussion and are subject to change; definitive terms will be disclosed in future SEC filings.</p>
