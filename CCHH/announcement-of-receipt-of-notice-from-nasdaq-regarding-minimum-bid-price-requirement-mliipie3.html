      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>CCH Holdings Ltd. received a Nasdaq notification dated Feb 3, 2026, stating the company's closing bid price was below the $1.00 minimum for 30 consecutive business days. The company has 180 calendar days (until Aug 3, 2026) to regain compliance by having its share price close at or above $1.00 for at least ten consecutive trading days. The notice is a deficiency notification only and does not currently affect listing or trading. CCHH says it is compliant with other Nasdaq continued listing standards, will monitor the share price, intends to take reasonable measures to regain compliance, and that the notice does not affect operations or SEC reporting.</p>
