      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation (NASDAQ: GLDD) and Saltchuk Resources, Inc. announced a definitive agreement for Saltchuk to acquire Great Lakes via a cash tender offer of $17.00 per share. The transaction implies an aggregate equity value of ~ $1.2 billion and total transaction value of $1.5 billion, a 25% premium to Great Lakes' 90-day VWAP as of Feb 10, 2026 and a 5% premium to its all-time high close. The deal is unanimously approved by both boards, supported by fully committed financing from Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank and PNC, and is expected to close in Q2 2026 subject to customary conditions including expiration of the HSR waiting period and tendering of a majority of shares. Saltchuk will acquire any remaining shares in a second-step merger at the same price; upon closing Great Lakes will operate as a standalone business within Saltchuk and its common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. The Great Lakes board unanimously recommends tendering shares.</p>
