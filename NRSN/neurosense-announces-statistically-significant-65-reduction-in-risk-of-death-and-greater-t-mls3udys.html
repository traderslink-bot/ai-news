      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>This is a press release from NeuroSense (NASDAQ: NRSN) reporting updated long-term survival data from the completed PARADIGM Phase 2b trial of PrimeC in ALS. Kaplan–Meier estimates show median survival of 36.3 months for patients who received PrimeC continuously vs. 21.4 months for those initially assigned to placebo and who crossed over in the open-label extension (≈14-month improvement, ~70% increase). A Cox model adjusted for baseline factors found a 65% reduction in risk of death with PrimeC (hazard ratio 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17–0.71; p = 0.0037); a log-rank test yielded p = 0.0218. The PARADIGM trial randomized 68 patients 2:1 (PrimeC:placebo) in a double-blind 6-month portion followed by an open-label extension. NeuroSense notes prior positive top-line results (slowed disease progression, favorable safety) and says it is engaging regulators about late-stage development. PrimeC is an extended-release fixed-dose combination of ciprofloxacin and celecoxib.</p>

      <strong>Positives</strong>
      <ul><li>Updated survival analysis shows median survival 36.3 months (PrimeC continuous) vs. 21.4 months (placebo then crossover).</li><li>Cox model indicates 65% reduction in risk of death with PrimeC (HR 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17–0.71; p = 0.0037).</li><li>Log-rank test comparing survival curves is statistically significant (p = 0.0218).</li><li>PARADIGM was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial.</li><li>Company previously reported statistically significant slowing of disease progression and favorable safety/tolerability.</li><li>PrimeC is composed of two FDA-approved drugs (ciprofloxacin and celecoxib) in an extended-release fixed-dose formulation.</li></ul>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Negatives</strong>
      <ul><li>Phase 2b trial enrolled a small total population (68 participants).</li><li>Placebo-assigned patients crossed over to active treatment in the open-label extension, which may affect interpretation of long-term comparative outcomes.</li><li>Results are from a completed Phase 2b study and are not from a pivotal late-stage trial; regulatory advancement is not guaranteed.</li><li>Press release contains forward-looking statements and notes risks and uncertainties (e.g., future trial outcomes, regulatory timing).</li></ul>
