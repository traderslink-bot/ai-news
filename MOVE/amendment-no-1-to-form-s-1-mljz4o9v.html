      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Form S-1/A filed by Movano Inc. to register for resale up to 545,456 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of 3,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock sold in a $3.0M bridge financing (subscription agreements dated November 6, 2025). The Series A Preferred will automatically convert at $5.50 per share upon closing of the announced merger with Corvex, subject to a 19.99% beneficial ownership conversion limitation. The filing discloses the Merger Agreement with Corvex (expected to close Q1 2026 subject to approvals), a Chardan “ChEF” Purchase Agreement (up to $1.0B commitment and registration of up to 110,000,000 shares), and that Corvex raised $37.2M in a private placement. Key capitalization and market facts: 1,141,930 shares of common stock outstanding as of Feb 4, 2026; pro forma outstanding would be 1,687,386 if all 545,456 shares are issued; Movano common trades on Nasdaq under MOVE (last reported price $13.52 on Feb 10, 2026). The prospectus notes Nasdaq equity non-compliance (stockholders’ equity approximately $1.637M as of June 30, 2025 and $(1.701)M as of Sept 30, 2025) and a Panel extension to March 30, 2026.</p>

      <strong>Positives</strong>
      <ul><li>Registers resale of 545,456 shares issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred, providing liquidity for selling stockholders.</li><li>Company has executed a definitive Merger Agreement with Corvex (board-approved by both companies) and expects closing in Q1 2026, subject to conditions.</li><li>Chardan Purchase Agreement (ChEF) commits up to $1.0 billion in potential equity financing (subject to conditions) and Movano has filed registration for up to 110,000,000 shares related to that facility.</li><li>Corvex completed a $37.2 million private placement concurrent with the Merger transaction.</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <strong>Negatives</strong>
      <ul><li>Movano is not currently in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (stockholders’ equity deficiency reported; Nasdaq granted an extension to March 30, 2026).</li><li>Issuance and resale of the 545,456 shares (and potential issuances under the ChEF facility and Merger consideration) will dilute existing shareholders; pro forma outstanding would increase materially and Corvex holders are estimated to hold the vast majority of combined company stock post-Merger (estimated ~94.9% on a fully diluted basis).</li><li>The Merger and related financings are subject to customary conditions (stockholder approvals, registration effectiveness, Nasdaq listing approval) and may not close; failure to complete the Merger could materially adversely affect both companies.</li><li>Movano will not receive any proceeds from resale of the registered shares; selling stockholders control timing and amount of any sales.</li></ul>
