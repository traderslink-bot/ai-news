      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>This Form 8-K (dated February 20, 2026) reports updates regarding the previously disclosed Business Combination Agreement among Signing Day Sports, Inc., BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, Inc., One Blockchain LLC and their merger subsidiaries. The filing confirms: (1) the Registration Statement on Form S-4 registering BlockchAIn common shares to be issued in the transaction has been declared effective by the SEC; (2) the definitive proxy statement/prospectus has been sent to Signing Day Sports stockholders to solicit approval of the proposed business combination; (3) the Exchange Ratio for converting Signing Day Sports common stock into BlockchAIn common shares will equal the last reported sale price of Signing Day Sports stock on the last trading day prior to closing divided by 7.5 (with rounding up to one share for fractional shares), and BlockchAIn may adjust the ratio to preserve proportionate post-closing holdings and meet NYSE American listing requirements, provided Signing Day Sports stockholders receive at least 8.5% of BlockchAIn common shares on a fully diluted basis post-closing; and (4) directors of One Blockchain and BlockchAIn currently hold no interests in Signing Day Sports. The filing reiterates customary closing conditions, risks, and encourages investors to read the S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus.</p>
