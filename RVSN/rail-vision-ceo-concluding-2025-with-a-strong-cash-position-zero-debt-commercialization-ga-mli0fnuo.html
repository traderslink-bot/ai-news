      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Rail Vision (NASDAQ: RVSN) issued a CEO corporate update highlighting 2025 commercial progress and strategic moves. The company reports a strong cash position and zero debt, secured a purchase order and advanced trials for its MainLine system with a major Central American freight operator, received a $335,000 follow-on order from a large mining customer in Latin America, and deepened its partnership with Israel Railways with potential ShuntingYard deployment. Rail Vision signed an MOU with Sujan Industries and launched a high-profile Proof of Concept in India. It acquired a 51% stake in Quantum Transportation, which announced a transformer-based neural decoder outperforming classical quantum error correction in simulations. The company’s 2026 priorities are converting pilots/POCs into revenue, scaling sales and distribution, expanding geographically through partners, and exploring quantum-AI integrations to support future autonomous rail capabilities. The release includes customary forward-looking statements and risk disclosures.</p>
