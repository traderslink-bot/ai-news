      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>SEC filing (Form 424B5) — TriSalus Life Sciences, Inc. filed a preliminary prospectus supplement for a registered public offering of 9,756,100 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $4.10 per share. The offering is being led by Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC as sole book-runner and includes a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,463,415 additional shares to cover over-allotments. Gross proceeds at the public offering price equal $40,000,010; underwriting discounts and commissions of $2,400,000 (6.0%) reduce proceeds to the company to $37,600,010 before expenses, and estimated net proceeds are approximately $37.0 million (or approximately $42.64 million if the over-allotment is exercised in full). The company’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol TLSI; the last reported sale price on February 18, 2026 was $4.64 per share. Pro forma shares outstanding immediately following the offering would be 59,811,590 (61,275,005 if the underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised). The filing discloses preliminary unaudited Q4 2025 revenue of ~$13.2M, full-year 2025 revenue of ~$45.2M and estimated cash and cash equivalents of ~$20.4M as of December 31, 2025. Use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes (capital expenditures, working capital, G&A). The prospectus supplement reiterates risk factors, dilution to new investors, and outstanding potential dilution from options, warrants and RSUs.</p>
