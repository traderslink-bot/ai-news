      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Press release: Hyperscale Data, Inc. (NYSE: GPUS) announced a strategic silver reserve program targeting acquisition of up to 100,000 ounces of silver over time. Purchases are expected to be funded from capital on hand and other available liquidity and executed opportunistically using a dollar-cost averaging approach. The company says it will secure storage/security solutions and provide public updates when material developments occur (amounts purchased, cumulative holdings, and related treasury metrics). The initiative is intended to complement Bitcoin holdings within the company's broader treasury strategy. The release reiterates the planned divestiture of ACG in Q4 2026 and notes the December 23, 2024 issuance of 1,000,000 shares of Series F Exchangeable Preferred Stock to common and Series C preferred holders.</p>
