      <strong>Summary</strong>
      <p>Trinity Biotech (NASDAQ: TRIB) announced on Feb 10, 2026 that it received full in‑country regulatory approval to commence upstream manufacturing activities for its WHO‑prequalified Uni‑Gold™ HIV rapid test under an offshored and outsourced production model. This approval is described as the final major regulatory milestone required to implement the new manufacturing approach (building on WHO authorization in Nov 2025). Management says the transition should expand gross margins, improve working capital efficiency, and enhance scalability to support future demand as part of the company's Comprehensive Transformation Plan.</p>
